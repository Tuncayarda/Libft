Libft is the first C project developed as part of the 42 Istanbul curriculum. In this project, a personal static library is created by reimplementing essential functions from the C standard library. The goal is to deepen understanding of C fundamentals such as memory management, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking. The project is divided into two main parts: rewriting standard functions and developing additional utility functions from scratch. Additionally, the bonus section introduces linked list operations, providing hands-on experience with dynamic data structures. This project builds a strong foundation in writing clean, secure, and reusable C code.
